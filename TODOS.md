# Todo

## Highlight
- `(Cast) thing`
- `Foo.class` 

## Autocomplete
- Autocomplete POJO constructor This(T f, U g) { this.f = f; ... }

## Navigation
- Go-to-subclasses
- Test coverage codelens
- Go-to-implementation for overridden methods
- `Thing#close()` shows 0 references for `try (thing)`

## Bugs 
- Imports MyEnum.* unnecessarily
- --add-exports arguments don't get inferred
- Deleting file doesn't clear it from javac
- External delete causes find-references to crash because it's still in FileStore.javaSources()
